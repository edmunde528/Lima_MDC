## Description:
We propose that the development of this graph will improve the food waste redistribution system and therefore improve access to food for those in need. The graph helps to highlight regions most in need of food, the corresponding food waste from supermarkets in that region as well the number of foodbanks in that region. Furthermore, a breakdown of the current number of Free School Meals provided per school stage in that region will help plot the most efficient distribution plan for food waste in that region. 
# Impactfulness 
10% of households in the UK live with moderate or severe food insecurity while a further 10% live in marginally food insecure households. This leaves the UK as the 4th worst nation in the EU with regards to food insecurity, with over 12 million individuals in the UK worried about where they will find their next meal. 
The problem of food insecurity is a persistent one and the efficient distribution of supermarket waste could serve as a long-term solution. 
There are an estimated 190 million meals wasted by supermarkets each year in the UK alone which, if distributed effectively, could significantly reduce food insecurity while helping bring households out of poverty. 
Illustrating the impact of the big four supermarkets (Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons) alone will allow one to use the most precise statistics while painting an accurate picture of the industry’s overall impact, given their combined 68% market share. Furthermore, encouraging the industry leaders to distribute their waste more efficiently will cause their competitors to follow suit in order to maintain their market share.  
# Innovativeness 
The persistence of hunger and poverty in even the most developed of countries demonstrates the complexity of the solution required. This graph solution maps out a number of variables impacting regions of the UK and in turn illustrates the resources needed by each to improve food security. As a result, the most efficient distribution of supermarket food-waste can be calculated. 
The graph solution leverages existing resources in foodbanks as the distribution centres of this excess food-waste. The extent to which they must increase their food distribution will determine the quantity of resources needed to facilitate this increase. 
# Ambitiousness
It would not be realistic to expect every tonne of waste to be distributed into meals for households in need. Although, mapping the food requirements of a region with the corresponding waste of the big four supermarkets will provide a foundation for planning the effective distribution of food-waste in the UK. 
# Applicability 
This graph would benefit all current and future foodbank users, as well as the wider communities they serve. It could easily be implemented by all supermarkets in the UK, as well as all foodbanks where they donate food.
The distribution of foodbank vouchers is already well documented, and data can be directly inputted into our graph to calculate the demand for food and the corresponding food-waste in different regions. In this sense, our graph could be implemented rapidly and used immediately. This means pressure on foodbanks could be reduced and people in need would be helped with only a small investment. 
Investment would be required to train people in how to use the graph, but this investment would be rewarded with an almost immediate positive impact on people in need.
A significant investment would also be required to allow for the food-waste to be distributed efficiently enough to provide nutritious meals for those in need. Perhaps the most significant hurdle to the application of this graph solution is inducing the supermarkets to commit to the project. 
The graph solution illustrates the food requirements of each region as well as the corresponding supermarket waste to highlight which areas have the capability to immediately improve their food security and which areas don’t. 
Further collection of data, particularly regarding food waste from other large supermarkets, should be considered to augment the system in order to make calculations more accurate which would make the re-distribution process more impactful. 

## Installation
There are two files in this repository containing zipped and unzipped export solution of this graph solution. 

## Known Issues and Future Improvements 
The Isle of Man is a known issue only having one Foodbank skewing the queries so it should be removed from the datasets.
For future improvements the graph allows for additional information to be easily added into the schema with some ideas being the use of lat-long coordinates of stores and Foodbanks to calculate the cost of distribution using fuel prices as well as the feasibility of this distribution. 

## Reflections
As supermarkets did not provide a breakdown of the nutritional values of their food waste it was difficult to calculate how this waste could be used most efficiently. In a similar vein more accurate data as to how long the surplus food had before it was inedible would serve to streamline the distribution process.
